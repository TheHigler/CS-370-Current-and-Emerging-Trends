# CS-370-Current-and-Emerging-Trends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

We were given the framework of an intelligent agent with the goal of teaching it to solve a maze and obtain treasure. We were also given Python code that represented the environment the intelligent agent will navigate, and code that stores the episodes of the game.  The code that we developed was to instruct how the intelligent agent should interact with the environment and dole out the type of reward the agent should receive.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists develop solutions with technology to both simple and complex problems. As humanity develops and utilizes
more technology, we need computer scientists to develop solutions that ultimately make businesses run smoother or operations more simple. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I will ensure I understand the problem I'm looking to solve so I know how best to tackle it. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

One of the most important ethical concerns I'll be responsible for are hidden bias'. It's easy to create a product that's biased without inherently doing it. For instance the google product that would designed to scan an image and give it a tag, would scan pictures of african americans and label them as gorillas.
